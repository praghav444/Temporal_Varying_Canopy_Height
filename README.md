# Estimating Temporally Varying Canopy Height at Eddy Covariance Sites
This repository presents a method to estimate temporally varying canopy height at eddy covariance flux tower sites.

Vegetation height is calculated based on atmospheric turbulence metrics (e.g., friction velocity, wind speed, heat flux), under stable atmospheric conditions.

Modeled canopy heights were compared against field-measured canopy heights at multiple wheat sites. The validation shows strong agreement between modeled and observed values of canopy heights.
